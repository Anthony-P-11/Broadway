Broadway Design Project

This project was created from scratch and was a simulation of a web development workflow.
I used Git for Windows to create the repositories along with the HTML and CSS files. I then edited those files with the Brackets editor.
Lastly, I updated this by created a remote repository on GitHub and uploaded these items. I have included a Git workflow file to help with visualizing how I executed the commands in Git.
